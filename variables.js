// A variable in JavaScript is a named storage location that holds a value. It allows you to store, modify, and retrieve data in your programs. Variables can hold different types of values, such as numbers, strings, objects, arrays, and more.
// what are the rules for naming variables in JavaScript?

// variable names must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
// // They can contain letters, numbers, underscores, and dollar signs.
// variable cannot be the same as a reserved keyword in JavaScript.
// variable names are case-sensitive.
// variable names cannot contain spaces or special characters like @, #, %, etc.
// by convention, variable names should be descriptive and use camelCase or snake_case.
// variable names can be of any length, but should be concise and meaningful.
// variable names should not start with a number.
// variable name spaces are not allowed.
// // Examples of valid and invalid variable names:
// var my_firstName = "John";
// var my_lastName$ = "Doe";
// var 123age = 30; // This will cause an error because variable names cannot start with a number
// var my@gmai = "js@gmail.dom"; // This will cause an error because '@' is not allowed in variable names;
// var _sahil_ = "Sahil"; // This is valid as underscores are allowed
// var $myVariable = "This is also a valid variable name"; // This is valid as
// var my Variable = "This will cause an error"; // This will cause an error because spaces are not allowed in variable names
// var my_Variable123 = "This is valid"; // This is valid as it starts with a letter and contains underscores and numbers
